QuickCGI
========

Perl Standalone GUI program helping in creating CGI programs.

This tool uses Perl Gtk to provide a GUI wizard. In the wizard, 
you can choose a databse, then a table(s, then fields and finally 
on clicking the finish(I remember so), you ll be able to generate 
a CGI file that you could upload directly to the chi-bin directory 
of the webserver. 

In 2005 I had a fracture on my arm and had to be taking rest for a 
month and I created this program as a new flavour of another 
program I created in Java long back.

Publishing this in hope that this will be helpfull atleasts to students 
to have some crazy thoughts.
