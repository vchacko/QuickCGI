Perl Standalone GUI program helping in creating CGI programs.

This tool uses Perl Gtk to provide a GUI wizard. In the wizard, you can choose a databse, then a table(s, then fields and finally on clicking the finish(I remember so), you ll be able to generate a CGI file that you could upload directly to the chi-bin directory of the webserver. 

In 2005 I had a fracture on my arm and was taking rest for a month. So what to do? engage in some hobby! Yep, I loved programming and I created this program as a new flavour of another program I created in Java long back.

Publishing this in hope that this will be helpfull atleasts to students to have some crazy thoughts.


Also requests some enthusiasts to create a test for the same :)
